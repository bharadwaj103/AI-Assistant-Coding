        "\n",
        "#### Key Ideas:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **`import math`**: We import the `math` library to use `math.pi` (the value of Pi) for circle calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **`def calculate_area(shape, **kwargs):`**: This defines the function:\n",
        "    *   `shape`: This tells the function *which* shape to calculate (e.g., 'circle').\n",
        "    *   `**kwargs`: This is a flexible way to pass *extra information* like `radius=5`, `length=4`, etc. It gathers these into a dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **`if/elif/else` for Different Shapes**: The function checks the `shape` you provide:\n",
        "    *   If it's a **circle**, it looks for `radius` and uses `π * radius²`.\n",
        "    *   If it's a **rectangle**, it looks for `length` and `width` and uses `length * width`.\n",
        "    *   If it's a **triangle**, it looks for `base` and `height` and uses `0.5 * base * height`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Error Handling**: If you forget to provide a necessary dimension (like `radius` for a circle) or provide an unknown shape, the function returns a helpful error message instead of crashing. This makes the function user-friendly.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, it's a smart function that figures out which area formula to use based on the `shape` you tell it, and it asks for the right measurements for that shape."

        "### Explanation of Code Variations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Using String Slicing (`original_string[::-1]`)**\n",
        "    *   **Core Approach:** This method leverages Python's powerful string slicing feature. The `[::-1]` slice creates a reversed copy of the string by stepping through it from end to beginning with a step of -1.\n",
        "    *   **Advantages:**\n",
        "        *   **Conciseness & Efficiency:** It's the most compact and often the most Pythonic way to reverse a string. It's implemented in C and is highly optimized.\n",
        "        *   **Readability:** For experienced Python developers, it's immediately understandable.\n",
        "    *   **Disadvantages:**\n",
        "        *   **Less Explicit:** For beginners, the `[::-1]` syntax might not be immediately obvious compared to a loop.\n",
        "        *   **Creates a new string:** Like all string operations in Python, it returns a new string rather than modifying the original in place.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Using a Traditional Loop**\n",
        "    *   **Core Approach:** This method iterates through each character of the original string and prepends it to a new, empty string. This builds the reversed string character by character.\n",
        "    *   **Advantages:**\n",
        "        *   **Explicitness & Clarity:** It clearly shows the step-by-step process of reversing the string, making it easy to understand for those new to programming concepts.\n",
        "        *   **Fundamental Understanding:** Demonstrates basic iteration and string concatenation.\n",
        "    *   **Disadvantages:**\n",
        "        *   **Verbosity:** It requires more lines of code compared to slicing or `reversed()`.\n",
        "        *   **Performance (for very long strings):** Repeated string concatenation in a loop (`result = char + result`) can be less efficient in Python due to string's immutability, as it creates many intermediate string objects. However, for typical string lengths, the difference is often negligible.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Using `reversed()` and `join()`**\n",
        "    *   **Core Approach:** The `reversed()` function returns an iterator that yields characters of the string in reverse order. The `join()` method then concatenates these characters back into a single string.\n",
        "    *   **Advantages:**\n",
        "        *   **Functional Approach:** Aligns with a more functional programming style, treating string reversal as a transformation.\n",
        "        *   **Readability:** Once familiar with `reversed()` and `join()`, this method is quite readable and expressive.\n",
        "        *   **Memory Efficiency:** `reversed()` returns an iterator, which processes elements one by one, avoiding the creation of a full reversed list in memory.\n",
        "    *   **Disadvantages:**\n",
        "        *   **Slightly Less Concise:** More verbose than slicing, though arguably more explicit in its intent than just `[::-1]`.\n",

        "\n",
        "The exercise clearly demonstrates **prompt sensitivity**, which is the ability of a language model to produce different outputs based on subtle variations in the input prompt, even when the underlying task is the same. Each prompt was carefully phrased to elicit a specific coding style or Python feature:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Prompt 1: 'Generate Python code to reverse a string using string slicing. Emphasize efficiency and conciseness.'**\n",
        "    *   **Influence:** The keywords 'slicing', 'efficiency', and 'conciseness' directly guided the generation of `original_string[::-1]`. This is the most efficient and concise Pythonic way for string reversal, perfectly matching the prompt's emphasis.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Prompt 2: 'Generate Python code to reverse a string using a traditional loop. Emphasize explicit iteration.'**\n",
        "    *   **Influence:** The phrase 'traditional loop' and 'explicit iteration' steered the model away from built-in methods and towards a more fundamental `for` loop construction, demonstrating how to build the reversed string character by character. The model understood that 'explicit iteration' meant showing the step-by-step process.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Prompt 3: 'Generate Python code to reverse a string using the `reversed()` function and `join()`. Emphasize a functional approach.'**\n",
        "    *   **Influence:** This prompt explicitly named the functions (`reversed()`, `join()`) and requested a 'functional approach'. The model responded by combining these two functions to achieve the reversal, highlighting a style where data transformations are performed via function calls and iterators, aligning with functional programming paradigms.\n",
        "\n",
        "This experiment showcases how precise prompt engineering can significantly influence the stylistic and methodological choices in the generated code, leading to functionally equivalent but structurally diverse solutions."
